# Visual Studio SFML Template 

## Installation

This guide describes installation for SFML with Visual C++ 15 (2017). While you are reading this, it is possible that newer versions
are available.

Be sure that SFML and Visual C++ Compiler have to match 100%, Otherwise there will be lots of errors.


### What do you need:
- Visual Studio, with v141 platform toolset and Windows SDK 10.0.15063.0 (read below)
- SFML 32-bit, compatible with v141 (Visual C++ 15 (2017))
- SFML 64-bit, compatible with v141 (Visual C++ 15 (2017))


### Download Links:
- SFML: https://www.sfml-dev.org
- Visual Studio: https://www.visualstudio.com/


### Prepare Visual Studio:
- Make sure that you have installed VS2017 (v141) platform toolset in your Visual Studio.
- Make sure that you have installed Windows SDK 10.0.15063.0 in your Visual Studio.

To check it go to Visual Studio Installer -> Individual Components 
to find (and install) above components. 

In my case there wasn't proper Windows SDK version
so I downloaded it manually from here: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/sdk-archive


### Prepare project with SFML:
1. Download project.
2. Get SFML 32-bit and SFML 64-bit from link above.
3. Copy unpacked SFML archives to the main project directory.
4. Be sure that SFML 32-bit folder is named just 'SFML' not 'SFML-X.X.X' etc. and SFML 64-bit folder is named 'SFML64'.


### Compiling and running:
If you successfully install SFML, open .sln file and build project in Debug or Release mode.

If you cannot compile project and there are lots of unresolved symbol errors or another strange things, something is wrong
and you should check again versions of platform toolsets, windows SDK and SFML.

In Debug mode (with dynamic linking) you have to copy dlls from SFML/bin to the folder with exe file.
Release mode uses static linking so you don't have to do that.

If you want to run this application on a computer without Visual C++ 2017 Runtime packages, 
you have to provide msvcp140.dll and vcruntime140.dll aside an EXE application.
